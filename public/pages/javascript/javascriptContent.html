    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
    <p>
      Javascript is a turing complete programming language which is primarily
      used in web developement to create dynammic and interactive webpages. It
      is a scripting language, which unlike compiled programming languages such
      as C++ or Java doesn't require the code to be compiled before it can be
      executed. JavaScript code is interpreted by the browser as it is loaded by
      the user. However, javascript can also be used as a server-side language,
      with the help of platforms such as <a href="nodejs"> Node.js</a>, to
      create web applications and server-side APIs. In this context, JavaScript
      is not necessarily a scripting language but a full-fledged programming
      language used for back-end development.
    </p>
    <h2>Loop methods</h2>
    In JavaScript, there are several inbuilt loop methods that can be used to
    iterate over arrays and other iterable objects. These methods provide a
    simpler and more concise way to write loops and are often preferred over
    traditional for and while loops. Below we will go through some examples:
    <h4>forEach()</h4>
    <p>
      This method takes a callback function as an argument and executes that
      function on each element in the array. It does not mutate the original
      array, neihter does it create a new one - however the callback function
      <i>can</i> do this. In the following example we will dynamically create a
      colored square for each of the colors in `colors` array defined in
      `forEachExample.js`. The plain HTML document for this page has an empty
      div with the id `coloredSquaresContainer` below this paragraph.
    </p>
    <div id="coloredSquaresContainer"></div>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">forEachExample.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-1">
const colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green'];

colors.forEach(color => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  div.style.backgroundColor = color;
  div.style.width = '100px';
  div.style.height = '100px';
  const coloredCubesContainer = document.getElementById("coloredCubesContainer").appendChild(div)
});          
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-1">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The code above calls the forEach() method to iterate over the `colors`
      array and passes an anonymos callback function as an argument to the
      forEach(). This callback funtion then creates a div element for each
      element in the `colors` array, styles it with the corresponding color as
      background, an finally appends it to the before mentioned div with id
      `coloredSquaresContainer` which has been styled to ensure horisontal
      alignment.
    </p>
    <h4>map()</h4>
    <p>
      Just as the forEach(), this method takes a callback function and iterates
      over the entire array that it is called upon - but a key difference is
      that map() stores the returned values in a new array. Let's look at an
      example:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">mapExample1.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-2">
const shoppingCartUSD = [
  { productName: "T-shirt", price: 15 },
  { productName: "Pants", price: 35 },
  { productName: "Shoes", price: 100 },
];

const shoppingCartDKK = shoppingCartUSD.map(item => ({...item, price: item.price*6.86}));       
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-2">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In the code above we have an array called `shoppingCartUSD` consisting of
      3 objects, each with 2 properties: `productName` and `price`. The price is
      in USD and we want an identical array but with prices in DKK. To do this
      we create a new array called `shoppingcartDKK` and set it equal
      `shoppingCartUSD.map()`. Inside the map() method we call an arrow function
      for each item in `shoppingCartUSD` and copy that item's properties using
      the spread operator `...item`, then the price property is updated by
      multiplying the USD price by the exchange rate between USD AND DKK. The
      newly created object is then added to the `shoppingCartDKK`.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      It is important to make the callback function create a new object for
      every object in the original array, and then update that object -
      otherwise we will mutate the original array and just copy pointers to it.
      The code below from `mapExample2` has the side effect of also mutating the
      original array.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      If still in doubt, try to log `shoppingCartDKK` and `shoppingCartUSD` from
      each example and you will see that only the code `mapExample2.js` mutates
      the original array.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">mapExample2.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-3">
const shoppingCartUSD = [
  { productName: "T-shirt", price: 15 },
  { productName: "Pants", price: 35 },
  { productName: "Shoes", price: 100 },
];

const shoppingCartDKK = shoppingCartUSD.map(item =>{
  item.price *= 6.86;
  return item;
});       
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-3">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>fetch()</h2>
    <p>
      This function is used to make network requests to a server and retrieve
      data from it. The fetch() function returns a promise that resolves to the
      response object representing the server's response to the request. The
      response object contains information about the response status, headers,
      and body. In the following example we will fetch quotes from
      <a href="http://quotable.io/random" target="_blank"> http://quotable.io/random</a> and
      show them in the quote generator below:
    </p>

    <div class="quote-block-header">Quote Generator</div>
    <div class="quote-container">
      <p id="quote">"Quote goes here..."</p>
      <small id="author">Author</small>
      <button id="quote-btn">New Quote</button>
    </div>

    <p>
      Below we see the javascript code associated with the `Quote Generator`.
      Each of the first three lines uses the `querySelector()` method to select
      an HTML element with a specific ID from this page. The fourth line
      attaches an eventListener that listens for a click event on the `quotebtn`
      which will execute the getQuote() method defined on the fifth line.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The `getQuote()` method calls the `fetch()` function with a URL pointing
      to the quotesAPI endpoint. Once the response is received, the function
      uses the `json()` method to extract the JSON data from the response, and
      then uses the extracted data to update the text content of two HTML
      elements on the page: one for the quote content, and another for the
      author of the quote.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">fetchExample.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-4">
const quote = document.querySelector("#quote");
const author = document.querySelector("#author");
const quotebtn = document.querySelector("#quote-btn");
quotebtn.addEventListener("click", getQuote);
function getQuote() {
  fetch("http://quotable.io/random")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      quote.innerText = `"${data.content}"`;
      author.innerText = data.author;
    });
}      
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-4">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      It is worth to mention that we use the `innerText` instead of `innerHTML`
      to set the content of the quote and author container to avoid Cross Site
      Scripting (XXS). If you for some reason have to use innerHTML, then you
      can use the tool <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/escape-html?activeTab=readme" target="_blank">escape-html</a>.
