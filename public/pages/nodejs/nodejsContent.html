    <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
    <p>
      Node.js is a runtime environment to run javascript outside of the browser
      - which means it can run on a server. This is how it works: a GET request
      is made, by someone visiting a URL that points to the node.js server, when
      the request is recieved node.js can handle the request and read the
      appropriate file from the server's file system, and then respond back to the
      client so they can view the requested site in their browser.
    </p>
    <h3>Get started</h3>
    <p>
      Navigate to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en</a> and
      download the LTS version (long term support version). Complete the installation wizard to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>To check if the installation completed succesfully write the following command in your terminal:</p>
    <br>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">Terminal</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-1">
node --version
          </code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-1">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    If the terminal outputs a version, the installation went succesfully.
