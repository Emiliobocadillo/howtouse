    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p>
      This site shows how to use tools and technologies such as Node.js, Express
      and Nodemon when building a fullstack webapplication. Furthermore the site
      will explain some useful javascript code and the structure of a REST API.

      For the ease of explanation it will be assumed that the user already has a
      basic understanding of Javascript and has an IDE installed. I will use VS
      Code, but you can use any IDE you want.
