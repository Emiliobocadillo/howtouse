    <h2>What is Nodemon?</h2>
    <p>
      Nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by
      automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the
      directory are detected. This is very convenient because you don't have to
      go to the terminal and write `node app.js` everytime you want to see your
      changes in the browser.
    </p>
    <h3>Get started</h3>
    <p>
      1. To install nodemon globally run the following command in your terminal:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">Terminal</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-1">
npm install -g nodemon
          </code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-1">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      2. You are nowsd able to run your node/express app with the command
      `nodemon app.js`
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Go to your app.js file and change the text in the
      <code>&lth1&gt</code> tag to `Hello Universe` and notice that the terminal
      will output the following:

    />

      4. We can create a `nodemon.json` which controls which filestypes, if
      updated, will initialize a restart of the server. The image below shows
      what filetypes nodemon is looking for changes in:
