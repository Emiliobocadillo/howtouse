    <h2>What is Express?</h2>
    <p>
      Express is a backend web application framework for building
      <a href="/restapi"> Rest API's </a>with Node.js. Express provides a wide
      range of features and functionality, including routing, and template
      engines. It also has a large and active community, which has developed
      many plugins and modules that can be easily integrated into an
      application.
    </p>
    <h3>Get started</h3>
    <p>1. Create a folder called `myapp` to contain the application</p>
    <p>2. Open the folder in VS Code</p>
    <p>3. Create a file called `app.js`</p>
    <p>4. Create a file called `package.json`</p>
    <p>5. Write a set of curly braces `{}` in the `package.json` file</p>

    />
    <p>
      6. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and write the command `npm
      install express` to install Express
    </p>
    <p>
      7. You should now have a folder called `node_modules`, a
      `package-lock.json` file. Futhermore, the `package.json` file should now
      contain a JSON object called `dependencies` with one key/value pair as
      shown on the screenshot below:
    </p>

      alt="Screenshot of VS Code"
    />
    <p>
      8. To allow us to use the import and export statements introduced in ES6
      (ECMAScript 6) modules we will have to add another key/value pair in the
      `package.json` to let Node.js know that we want to use it - write `"type":
      "module"` as shown below:
    </p>

      src="../../assets/images/screenshots/Express3.png"
      alt="Screenshot of VS Code"
    />
    <p>
      9. Now let's import express in the `app.js` and instantiate it in a
      variable called `app`. To do so, copy the code below and paste it into
      `app.js`
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-1">
import express from "express";
const app = express();          
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-1">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      10. In the bottom of `app.js` we will now define a port and make the app
      listen on that port. When an Express app is listening on a specific port,
      it means that it is actively waiting for incoming HTTP requests on that
      port number, and any incoming requests that match the app's defined routes
      and methods will be handled by the app.
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-2">
const PORT = 8080;
app.listen(PORT, (error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  } else {
    console.log("Server is running on", PORT);
  }
});         
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-2">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      11. It is now time to create our first route and with it let the app
      handle a HTTP GET request to the specific endpoint `/`. For now we will
      just let the app respond with a simple <code>&lth1&gt</code> tag:
    </p>
    <div class="code-container">
      <div class="code-block-header">app.js</div>
      <div class="code-wrapper">
        <pre>
          <code id="code-3">
app.get("/", (req, res) =>{
    res.send(`&lth1&gt Hello World &lth1&gt`);
});      
</code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-button" id="copy-button-3">copy</button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      12. It is finally time to run the app! Open the integrated terminal in VS
      Code and write the command `node app.js`.
    </p>
    <p>13. Open your browser and navigate to the endpoint we created on <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/ </a></p>
    <p>14. You should be able to see the following in the browser:</p>
